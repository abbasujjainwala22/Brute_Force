Password cracker with brute force technique 

This script tries all possible combinations of uppercase, lowercase letters and numbers up to a length of 8. If it finds the password, it returns it. Otherwise, it returns None. Remember the longer the password is the more time it'll take to crack it.

Please note: This is a very inefficient and time-consuming method of cracking passwords, and itâ€™s unlikely to be effective against passwords of reasonable length and complexity. Furthermore, most systems have protections against this kind of attack, such as limiting the number of failed attempts.
